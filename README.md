To run locally on your machine for development follow the steps below:
```
git clone https://github.com/Talent-DAO/JoDW-Demo.git app
```
Navigate to the `/app` directory or whatever you chose to name it (it is the root directory of the monorepo).

`yarn install` should run automatically using the .husky file (this can be updated to suit your needs)
and if it happens to not cooporate, just run `yarn install` manually.

Next, you'll want to open up a new terminal window (whether in your VS Code, other IDE, or any terminal program) and run `yarn chain`. This will fire up a local blockchain for the application to connect to.

Once your local chain in up and running you can deploy the contracts locally using `yarn deploy` the default network is set in `/app/packages/hardhat/hardhat-config.js`

And finally, after your contracts are deployed you can run `yarn start` to fire up the front end.
